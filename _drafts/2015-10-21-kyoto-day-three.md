Today we decided to give a rest to our rear ends and have some more sightseeing with the public transport.
Also it was a day when we had a booked visit in the Emperial Garden in Kyoto, and it would have been a long cycle if we had decided to do this.

We started the day with light brekfast and the headed towards 2 near by temples :

Then we went to the bus station to purchase the daily bus ticket. On the way there we were approached by bunch of kids that had homework to do.
The howework was to talk with tourists and ask them a few questions. Of course we were happy to help them out and in return we got a origami from them, and we took a photo with them
