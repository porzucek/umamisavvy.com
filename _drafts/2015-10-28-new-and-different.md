### Vending machines

They are abundant. You can find them almost on every corner, at temples, bus stops, train stations, everywhere. They mainly contain beverages, and very rarely you can spot one with cigarets or ice-creams.

At the front of the the vending machine you have a panel with the display of all items. One thing that surprised me was that the machine also serves warm beverages. When you select a coffee, you will get a hot one. The price of the items oscillates between 100 and 160 yen.


### Surgical masks

It's quite common to spot a Japanese person with a surgical mask on their face. There are a few reasons why they wear it, this is a good [article](http://qz.com/299003/a-quick-history-of-why-asians-wear-surgical-masks-in-public/) about the history, that goes many years back in time.

Here is a short list of the most common reasons:

- worn by people who are already feeling under the weather and don't want to spread theirs germs to the public. I read that it started back in the time when there were a massive influenza outbreak in Japan (beginning of XX century), and it was one of the ways to stop it
- worn by people who are allergic to hay fever and want to keep pollen at bay
- to keep the face warm in the winter
- to moisturize nostrils in the summer and winter when the air con and heaters are on full blast
