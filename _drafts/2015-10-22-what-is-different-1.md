### High-tech toilets

It's one of the things I had known about before coming to Japan, but it still shocked me :-)

Toilets! Especially toilet desks. They are packed with features that I'd love to see everywhere. First and foremost:

- bidet to cleanse yours bottom - water is warm and it saves time. You can control the strength of the current as well.
- seat warming - In some models you can control how warm it should be.

Some of them have even more features, like:

- pressure sensor to only activate when someone is sitting.
- motion sensor to open the lid when someone walks in.
- spray.

Also some of them have clever tank design with a tap on top of it.
So when flushing you can wash your hands, and that water will be used for the next flush.

What's the most surprising is the prevalence of those toilets. I expected them in private houses, hotels, good restaurants, but not in the public toilets at the train stations or somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

You can read more on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilets_in_Japan)

### Power lines

There are plenty of overhead power lines in the Japanese cities. I read that the main reason was economical one, it was just cheaper to do this that way.
But the scenery is disrupted. Once you look up at the sky you will see crisscrossed black lines, that form a roof above your head.
