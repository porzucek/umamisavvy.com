### Toilets

It's one of the things that I knew about before coming to Japan, but It still shocked me :-)

Toilets! They are advance pieces of tech and have things that we should also have in the West, first and foremost:

- seat warming - it's just simply the best thing since the sliced bread and instant noodles.
- anus washing - initially I was a bit scared, but the water is warm, and it keeps things clean where they should be!

Also they have ingenious tank design with the tap on top of it.
So when flushing you can wash your hands, and the water will be used for the next flush.

You can read more on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilets_in_Japan)

### Power lines

There are plenty of overhead power lines in the Japanese cities. I don't know why, but it bothers me.
I read that the main reason was economical one and it was just cheaper to do this that way.
But the scenery is disrupted. Once you look up at the sky you will see crisscrossed black lines, that form a roof above your head.
