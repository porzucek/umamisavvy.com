### Toilets

It's one of the things I had known about before coming to Japan, but it still shocked me :-)

Toilets! And especially toilet desks. They are packed with a few features that I'd love to see everywhere. First and foremost:

- seat warming - it's simply the best thing since the sliced bread and instant noodles. In some models you can control how warm it should be.
- anus washing - initially I was a bit scared, but the water is warm and it saves time. You can control the strength of the current.

Also some of them have clever tank design with a tap on top of it.
So when flushing you can wash your hands, and that water will be used for the next flush.

You can read more on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilets_in_Japan)

### Power lines

There are plenty of overhead power lines in the Japanese cities. I read that the main reason was economical one, it was cheaper to do this that way.
But the scenery is disrupted. Once you look up at the sky you will see crisscrossed black lines, that form a roof above your head.
