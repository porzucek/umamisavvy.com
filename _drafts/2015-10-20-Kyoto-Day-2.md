Today we had a very active day cycling between turistic spots from 8:30am till 7pm. The weather was absolutely amazing - worm and sunny. That plus beautiful colors of autumn gave a picturesque scenario for sightseeing. The places we visited:


- Golden Pavilion, that looks really neat when the sun is out. Thing that struck my attention was lack of leaves on the ground, and you could see that people work hard to maintain the impression of natural beauty.
- Ginkakuji Temple (aka Sliver Pavilion) -
- Kiyomizu Temple - Probaly the most packed place we've seen so far. In our travel guide it was must see, and probably not only in
- Fushimi Inari-taisha - This place is known from the

Even though those places were very beautiful the bit I enjoed the most was cycling between them, and admiring
the beauty of the city.
