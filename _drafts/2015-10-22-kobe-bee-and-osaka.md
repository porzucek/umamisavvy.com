We checked out from our Kyoto apartment before 8am, and walked to the station.
The plan was to drop luggage in Osaka (30min from Kyoto), and then go to Kobe to try out the famous **Kobe beef**.

We found a restaurant that serves original kobe beef and wouldn't make us bankrupted. The price seemed reasonable for **A5** grade meat and reviews were really good.

Here are some photos from the feast:

Btw, if someone doesn't know what kobe beef is, here's a good [write-up](http://notesofnomads.com/kobe-beef/). (tldr: Kobe beef is a beef from the Japanese cattle (Wagyu), that meets special quality standards and is characterized with superior flavor, tenderness and high amount of fat. There are many myths about it, for instance that farmers massage cows and give them beer to drink, but all of them seems to be fairy tales)

As we didn't really have any other plans for Kobe, but we were close to the kobe city hall we went to the observation deck on the 24th floor to have a look on the harbour.  Visibility wasn't great so photos are so-so.

After that, we returned to Osaka, and headed towards our new accommodation.

And here is not the brightest part of our trip so far. The room wasn't up to scratch.
It was a type of room that I read about in books about Tokyo 20 years ago (small and without bathroom). The problem wasn't that it was tiny(9m^2) and it had only futons. The problem was musty smell, bath outside the building, poor quality of toilets and general feeling that we were ripped off. On the other hand though, the location of the place was great. 10 min by foot from Dōtonbori, close to the train station and big supermarket.

Here are few photos from **Dōtonbori**, one of the most known areas of the city, often described as "survival of the flashiest".
