It took us almost 2 days to come back to Krakow. Lesson learnt, never again.

There was one thing we had done wrong, and one thing that was out of our control that contribute to that travel time.

The thing we screwed up is the time of our flight from Miami to NYC. It was at 7am, and the flight from NYC back to Europe was at 10pm.
Also we had to wake up quite early to return the car.
We spent about 12h on the JFK airport and maybe it wasn't too bad as we had Twin Peaks season 1 to watch, but it was quite tiring.
What we should have done or at least consider was to rebook our flight and check how much would be to fly straight from Miami.
When we booked our flights to the States we didn't really have a clear vision of the trip so that's why we went for a return flight from NYC.
I googled and the rebooking isn't very expensive and it's 70euro per ticket, but then of course it's depend on the price of the ticket and late bookings are pretty expensive, over $1k per ticket, so probably we wouldn't do it after all.

The second thing that was out of our control was the delay of our flight to Frankfurt:/ That resulted in missing the flight to Krakow, so we had to wait for the next one for about 4h.

From NYC we flew with [Boeing 474-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-8), the biggest aircraft we've ever flown. I'm not sure whether it's b/c of the size of the plane, weather, or that we sat in the back, but it was very bumpy at the beginning. And when it's so bumpy you can't stop thinking that something might just go wrong - it's pretty scary feeling.
