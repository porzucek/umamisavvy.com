So, yes this is it! What might be second after the best trip in our life (so far) :-) Lost of expectations and hope for real chill out for next two and half weeks. We have some preconceptions about USA, that we decided to write down before really seeing it (so we can then compare it with reality):

- Everything is big, streets, buildings, cars, food, people - everything is xxl
- People are super nice
- In New York you can't hear your thoughts - noise pollution
- Food is unhealthy and portions are enormous
- In New York we'll see all sorts of people
- Everyone carry a gun ;-)
- Lot's of weirdos, homeless, hobos..
- Everyone owns a car
