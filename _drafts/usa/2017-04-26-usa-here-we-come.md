I have preconceptions about USA, that I decided to write down before really seeing it.

- Everything is big, streets, buildings, cars, food, people - everything is xxl
- People are super nice
- In New York you can't hear your thoughts - noise pollution
- Food is unhealthy
- In New York we'll all sorts of People
- Everyone has a gun
- Lot's of weirdos and homeless, hobos
-
