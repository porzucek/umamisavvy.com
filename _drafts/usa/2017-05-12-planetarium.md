So this is it - last day of our US trip.

As almost every day we woke up just after 8am, and slowly started the day.
Previous day we had noticed that there's a new Science Museum in Miami and we decided to check it out.
It was opened just a week ago so everything there was brand new, very interactive, with attractions like laser show, lab where you could learn about the human body and psychology. But the top 2 attractions we liked the most were planetarium and the three level Aquarium.

The planetarium has this huge, oval screen with extremely good picture quality. It just makes you feel like you are inside the movie.

We saw 2 movies: Asteroid: Mission Extreme 3D and Dynamic Earth. Both very good.

Aquarium shows depths and the surface of aquatic ecosystems. We enjoyed the view of colourful fish and other amazing sea creatures. Also it was the first time we saw hammerhead shark.

Here its worth mentioning that it surprised us a lot that all information in the museum was provided in both English and Spanish. Actually it is easier to hear Spanish on the streets - both Miami and Miami Beach made us feel like we are in South America :-)

After the museum we had very good Mediterranean-style lunch and went for some clothing shopping.

In the evening we took our car and went looking for the part of the city called Little Havana - as we couldn't find anything interesting there we continue driving, admiring the city during the sundown.

And that is how our last day in the US came to an end. Now we just need to survive a very long journey home and adjust to Polish weather ;-)
