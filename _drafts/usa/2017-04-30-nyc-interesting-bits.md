Water tanks on the buildings

One of the views that were <przykuwaÄ‡ uwage> quite bizzare and didn't fit the picture of cities I'm used to were the water tanks on the buildings.
You could think that's a relict from the past. Something that I only saw in the western movies and usually it wasn't put on the building but somewhere close to the town. But it looks that for many buildings in NYC this how the water gets to theirs apartment. During the day / night water is pumped into the tank, and then thanks gravitation it's flowing through a tap.

Underground Steam

In some parts of Manhattan, mainly close to Times Square you will see a steam getting out from the underground. That view reminded me the one from Beppu (JPN) but as far as I know NYC is not located on any active volcanic areas.
The reason of that steam is the way how parts of the city is heated. Steam is transported through the pipes and used for variety of things.
Pipes are boiling hot and in case...

Breakfast pizza

City bikes
