We woke up pretty early to get to *Islands of Adventures* (part of the Universal complex) as soon as the gates are open.
It will be hard to describe what we had experienced as it was truly amazing and unforgettable! We've mentioned before that people here know how to make a show and entertain - todays day just confirmed that statement.

Park is build from several 'islands' and each of thous 'islands' had a theme and an attraction.

The Incredible Hulk Coaster is a pretty fast and adrenaline-triggering ride.
