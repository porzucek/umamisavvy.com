On Monday we woke up quite early as we had our flight to *Orlando*. Transfer to the airport went smoothly and (as always) we arrived 3h before the flight :D

The flight from New York to Orlando takes about 3h. On the plane we met a very friendly ex-new-yorker who was helping to clean the remains after 9/11. He shared a fee handy tips about Florida and interesting facts about USA in general.
When we left the plane we were struck by the tropical heat. 30+ degrees. 50% of us is very happy with the weather, another 50% is afraid to melt ;-)

Picking up car wasn't difficult, as we had arranged everything before, but there was one thing we weren't aware of.
There're tolls on the Florida's roads, and we were manipulated by the guy at car rental that we need to pay for it at the desk.

Driving in Florida is not difficult, roads are in much better shape then in the NYC and are well marked. Our airbnb accommodation is also nice. It is a house transferred into a hostel so we've met other travelers - girls from Australia and a couple form Germany. The only annoying thing is a very loud A/C in the house (but at least it is nice and cool inside).
We had very laid back afternoon - mostly planning the rest of our trip. For dinner we went down to a nearby Mall and I think we had one of the best burgers so far in USA.

In the original plan on Tuesday we were planning to go to the Universal Studios Island of Adventures. But as the weather forecast predicted a rainy day we've decided to go to *Kennedy Space Centre* which is also the NASA facility.

It appeared to be one of the best museum experience we had in our lives. Americans know how to do a show - and this museum was an amazing show!
We've spent all day there
