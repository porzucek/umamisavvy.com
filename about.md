It began early this year(2015). We didn't really think about going to Japan, but it was on our list.

After a few weeks of not very intensive pondering and gauging other options like New Zealand, Thailand, we made up our minds, and decided on Japan.

**Why?**

Why there's always Why?

Hard to tell, a few reasons came to mind.

I was always anime fan, so I was interested in Japan since the high school.
Agata is a big fan of Ghibli Studio's movies.
We both crave Japanese cousin, especially ramens and sushi.
And in general, Japan seems to be so different from anything we know.
That originality, taste of difference was so tempting that we couldn't resist and we purchased tickets.
