Today we were traveling from midmorning to early afternoon and arrived in **Takayama**. The train journey was quiet time consuming but very picturesque.

Takayama is a city in the mountainous Hida (part of Northern Japanese Alps). It is famous for its beautifully preserved old town.
Streets and main roads were established around castle, temples and shrines that contributed to the development of busy town. Nowadays approximately 90.000 people live here but you can tell that the place is very popular amongst tourists.

One of our favorite dish in Japan is soba noodles. We've had it a few times already, but in Takayma there is a place where they make soba since late 19th century. Of course we gave it a shot and so far it was the best soba noodles we ate. The meal came with a handy leaflet describing the proper way of eating soba - "slurping way". It's said, that slurping enriches the falvour of soba sauce, and we can definetely confirm that it works. I'm wondering why in the western culture slurping had developed as bad manners, but in Japan it's acceptable and even encouraged.


We always wanted to try traditional **soba noodles** a type of thin noodle made from buckwheat flour. In Kanazawa there is a place where sobe is made by the third generations and they definitely reached the perfection in sobe art :-)
