Today we had a very active day cycling between various tourist spots.
The weather was absolutely amazing - warm (26C) and sunny. That, plus beautiful colors of autumn, gave a picturesque scenario for a sightseeing.

Here are the places we visited:

Golden Pavilion - it looks really neat when the sun is out.

Ginkakuji Temple (aka Sliver Pavilion) - the owner - Ashikaga Yoshimasa - was planning to cover it with silver however, due to a war, that plan was never realized.

Entrance to Chion-in temple - we didn't have time to visit the temple itself. Next time :)

Kiyomizu Temple - probably the most packed place we've seen so far. In our travel guide it's must-see, number one spot in Kyoto.

Fushimi Inari-taisha - This place is known from the tori gates route. It's about 4km of walk that took us about 1.5h.

Even though those places are beautiful and very impressive the bit we enjoyed the most was cycling between them.
Going through narrow streets of the city, where every corner is different and astonishing, gave us an idea how life of Kyoto residents looks like.

For dinner we went for soba noodles. The restaurant was in the mall connected to the Kyoto main station.
