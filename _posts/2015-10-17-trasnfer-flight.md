It's almost midnight. We just landed in Istanbul and now waiting for our flight to Tokyo.

Transfer flights are very easy. There are sufficient directions at the airport so there's no way to get lost.

Airport itself seems to be of moderate size. Even though it's almost midnight the congestion of people is comparable to that on the London tube in the rush hours.

So far we are satisfied with Turkish airlines. The dinner was tasty, or at least the meat option - Agata's vegetarian dish didn't hit the spot.

The time is passing reading "Sleepslessness(insomia) in Tokyo", thanks Beata!
