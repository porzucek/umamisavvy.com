It's almost midnight. We just landed in Istanbul and now waiting for our flight to Japan.

Transfer flights are extremely easy. There are directions everywhere and there's now way to get lost.

Istanbul's airport seems to be of moderate size, but even though it's almost midnight the congestion of people is comparable to that on the London tube in the rush hours.

So far we are satisfied with Turkish airlines. The dinner was tasty, or at least the meat option, because Agata's vegetarian dish didn't hit the spot.

The time is passing reading "Sleepslessness(insomia) in Tokyo", thanks Beata!
