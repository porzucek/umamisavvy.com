Kanazawa is famous for its **Kenroku-en Gardens**. Ranked as one of the top three gardens in Japan definitely deserves its fame. Even though it was raining we had a really good time walking around that beautifully maintained area.

Next to Kenroku-en is Kanazawa castle. Built in 1580 was called the "castle of 1000 tatami" because of its size. We didn't visit the interiors just admire from the outside and walked around the castle park.

As Kanazawa is on the Japan sea coast, it is famous from fresh sea food. There is a big market (Omicho Market) where you can find all kinds of goodies that the sea can give you.

With all the fresh fish available there are plenty of sushi restaurants. With small help of trip advisor we went to a very nice and affordable place. 50% of us was satisfied after the meal :-) Not that the sushi was bad, Agata just prefers maki sushi, that don't have so big chunks of fresh fish.
