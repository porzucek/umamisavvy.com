Japanese people are extremely helpful!

Today we decided to visit a hospital to check what's wrong with Michal's eye. Since we've landed in Narita it was all red and sensitive to light, but in the last 2 days the pain has aggravated. The hospital was about 40min away from our place so we went there by foot.
At the information we were told that the hospital takes an extra fee on top of the cost of the visit and we would have to wait approximately 3 hours for the appointment. It was a bit too long for us, so we asked if there is any other quicker option. The person at the reception pointed us to an eye clinic near by, and even left the building to show us the way.
We went the direction he told us, and about 3 min later the same guy chased us up just to return a pen we had left behind! He also showed us the correct way to the clinic, almost opening doors for us. He was awesome!

At the clinic there was one doctor speaking pretty good English so it went very smoothly (took only 45min). Michal is not going to die. He received necessary eye drops and they even took the pictures of his eyes from the inside :-)

Once all the health issues were resolved, we headed up to the train station. The plan for today was Miyajima.
**Miyajima** is an island close to Hiroshima, that is famous from **[Itsukushima Shirne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itsukushima_Shrine)** and its **"floating" tori gate**. It's another place that is listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Oh, and there are deer as well.

And they find maps and tickets very tasty...

Other worth seeing place on the Island is [Mount Misen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Misen).
It offers great view from the top, and it's really rewarding if you climb it yourself without using the ropeway. The mountain is 540m high and there are 2 routes to the top. Both are about 2.5km long. It took us 1h and probably 200ml of sweat to climb to the top, and 40min, without much sweat to descend.

It was almost a sunset when went down from the mountain:

For a dinner we had delicious Yakitori in [Sumiyaki Ichidaime](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g298561-d5993958-Reviews-Sumiyaki_Ichidaime-Hiroshima_Hiroshima_Prefecture_Chugoku.html). Yakitori, simply put, is a skewer with meat (usually chciken, but selection may vary) that is grilled over the charcoal fire. It's very popular as a side dish to drinks, and in Japan they say "Yakitori with beer" to encourage people to go out for drinks.
