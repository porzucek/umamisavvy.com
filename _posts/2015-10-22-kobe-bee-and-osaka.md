We checked out from our Kyoto apartment before 8am, and walked down to the station.
The plan was to drop the luggage in Osaka (30min from Kyoto), and then go to Kobe to try out the famous **Kobe beef**.

It didn't take us long to find a good restaurant with a help of tripadvisor. The place we found served **A5** grade beef in the reasonable price and reviews were great.

Here are some photos from our feast:

Btw, if someone doesn't know what kobe beef is, here's a good [write-up](http://notesofnomads.com/kobe-beef/). (tldr: Kobe beef is a beef from the Japanese cattle (Wagyu), that meets special quality standards and is characterized with superior flavor, tenderness and high amount of fat. There are many myths about it, for instance that farmers massage cows and give them beer to drink, but all of them seems to be fairy tales)

We didn't have any other plans for Kobe, but we were close to the city hall and we read that it has an observation deck on the 24th floor so we went there to have a look on the harbour.

After that, we returned to Osaka, and headed towards our new accommodation.

And here is not the brightest part of our trip so far. The room wasn't up to scratch.
It was a type of room that I read about in books about Tokyo 30 years ago (small and without bathroom). The problem wasn't that it was tiny(9m^2) and it had only futons. The problem was musty smell, bath outside the building, poor quality of toilets and general feeling that we were ripped off. On the other hand though, the location of the place was great. 10 min by foot from Dōtonbori, close to the train station and big supermarket.

Here are few photos from **Dōtonbori**, one of the most known areas of the city, often described as "survival of the flashiest".
