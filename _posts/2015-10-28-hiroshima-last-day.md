Comparing to other days we started this one quite late. We planned to rest a bit more and we slept until 10am.
The only thing that we really had in our "itinerary" was **[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Museum)**. It's a museum that documents the WW2 atomic bombing of the city. It mainly covers the day of the bombing, but also describes Hiroshima before and after 6th of August 1945 and explains who the decision to drop the bomb was made. The museum exhibits belongings of the victims that were left behind, photos and other materials that conveys the horror of that event.

The museum struck a chord with the [Grave of the fireflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies), which is an animated film by Studio Ghibli. It's not really related to a-bombing as the action happens in Kobe, but it depicts extremely sad story of a few last weeks of the war. It's very emotional movie and definitely a must-see.

Later that day we had some time to relax, read, try oysters that are popular in Hiroshima.

I remembered that I still don't like them. I thought that maybe fresh ones, made by Japanese, will somehow convert my taste palate.

At the end of the day we went to a game arcade centre to play [Pachinko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko). Pachinko is the only type of gambling game available in Japan. It similar to a one-handed-bandit in the sense that you don't really have much control over it, but you can win something. I don't really understand the rules, but the way to operate it is easy:

Pachinko is a vertical board with pins on the sides of it (the centre is occupied by display), and a winning small hole at the bottom.
From the top left side of the board you release small balls. The balls are bouncing of the pins and if they drop into the winning hole you're happy, otherwise you're sad. You start with a set of balls, and the amount of them depends on how much did you pay.
The only thing you control is the force of releasing the balls, which you do with a knob. That's pretty much it, I think :-)
