We made it! We have landed in one piece, actually in 2 :-) on Narita Airport!
The flight from Istanbul to Tokyo last 10h50m (on Boeing 777/300). In total we probably slept only 5h, but we felt rested and ready to action:-)

During the flight we met Thomas, German guy married to a Japanese lady. He helped us with all the paper work on the Airport
(Visa application form and duty declaration). Once we've done all the paperwork, got visas, and reclaimed our luggage we went to the ticket office to get our JR pass.

The next thing was to buy *sucia* card, which is a contactless type of card that you can use to pay in vending machines, supermarkets, subway and many other places across Japan. To check it out, we made our first vending machine purchase in Japan, a bottle of green tea that tasted almost like a real one.

Btw, Agata was really happy that her "3" network roaming is finally working (probably first time ever abroad).
