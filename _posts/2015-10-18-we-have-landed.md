We made it! We have landed in one piece, actually in 2 :-) on the Narita Airport!
The flight from Istanbul to Tokyo last 10h50m (on Boeing 777/300). In total we probably slept only 5h, but we felt rested and ready to action:-)

During the flight we met Thomas, German guy married to a Japanese lady. He helped us with all the paper work on the airport
(Visa application form and duty declaration). Once we did all the paperwork, got visas, and reclaimed our luggage we went to the ticket office to get our JR pass. All was easy and straightforward. Everyone is very nice and helpful.

The next thing was to buy *sucia* card, which is a contactless type of card that can be used to pay in vending machines, supermarkets, public transport and many other places across Japan. To check it out, we made our first vending machine purchase in Japan, a bottle of green tea that tasted almost like a real one.

Btw, Agata was really happy that her "3" network roaming is finally working abroad (probably first time ever).
