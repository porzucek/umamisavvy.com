What a day... The plan was to go to Nara (old capital city of Japan) but instead we've learnt something about health care system in Japan...
We had an unplanned visit in a hospital, but fortunately it all finished well.

We ended up in a clinic where was an English speaking doctor and with help of Google Translate and helpful people I received a necessary treatment. We've also found out how much the taxi service in Osaka cost. First 2 km is 620 yen and after that every 300m is for 80 yen. You need to be very specific where you want to go and ideally give the directions to a taxi driver.   

Also we have made a decision that we won't be staying in our current accommodation any more. The standard was definitely not what we have expected for that amount of money. We made a quick search on aribnb and booking.com.
Initially we made an instant booking on the former one, but the host didn't reply in 2h so we have decided to book a hotel room. After that we had to call airbnb service to cancel all the bookings, the current one and the one we had made for tonight. We had to call them because it is the only way to cancel bookings that are in progress or starting at the same day.
Thanks to Skype, the 20min call cost us only 60 pens, and not 40 GBP through the roaming.

The next thing was to claim the money back from our hosts. We've opened a ticket in the airbnb resolution centre and after exchanging a few emails we got the money back.

Moving to a new room was a matter of an hour, as the hotel we found was about 15min walk from our first place.

After a few hours of rest we went down to [D≈çtonbori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dtonbori). It was even closer than before, so we strolled around and got familiar with the area.

For dinner we had local speciality, [takoyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takoyaki) - a ball-shaped snack made of flour and filled with diced octopus, green onion and cooked in a special takoyaki pan.

We then had some drinks and even took pictures with passing by sailors moon :-)
