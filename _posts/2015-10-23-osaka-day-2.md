What a day... The plan was to go to Nara (old capital city of Japan) but instead of that we've learnt how the Japanese health care system works.

We used google to find a hospital with English speaking staff but when we arrived there all we got was a piece of paper saying 'We don't speak English. You need to speak Japanese or have a translator'. My tears and miserable appearance cause a compassion amongst
the hospital staff and somehow they gave as directions to another clinic where we could communicate in English. With help of Google Translate and very friendly and helpful people I received a necessary treatment. We've also found out how much the taxi service in Osaka cost. First 2 km is 620 yen and after that every 300m is for 80 yen. You need to be very specific where you want to go and ideally give the directions to a taxi driver.   

Also we have made a decision that we want to change the accommodation. The standard of the one we were staying in was definitely not what we have expected for the money we've paid. We made a quick search on aribnb and booking.com to find something better.
Initially we made an instant booking on airbnb, but the host didn't reply in 2h so we have decided to book a hotel room. After that we had to call airbnb service to cancel all the bookings. We had to call the client support line because it is the only way to cancel bookings that are in progress or starting at the same day. Thanks to Skype, the 20min call cost us only 60 pens, and not 40 GBP through the roaming.
The next thing was to claim the money back from our hosts. We've opened a ticket in the airbnb resolution centre and after exchanging a few emails we got the money back.

Moving to a new room was a matter of an hour, as the hotel we found was about 15min walk from our first place.

We rested for few hours and went down to [D≈çtonbori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dtonbori). The naiberhood was even closer from the new accommodation so we strolled around to get familiar with it.

For dinner we had local speciality, [takoyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takoyaki) - a ball-shaped snack made of flour and filled with diced octopus, green onion and cooked in a special takoyaki pan.

We then had some drinks and even took pictures with a sailors moon :-) Michal's childhood dream came true.
