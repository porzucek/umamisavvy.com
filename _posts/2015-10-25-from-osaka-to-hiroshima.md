After our second shinkansen trip we arrived to **Hiroshima**. The city makes a very good first impression and it is so hard to imagine
 it was just 60 years ago, when it was destroyed by the first atomic bomb in the history.
 Now Hiroshima looks modern, organized and very welcoming. All important sights are easy to access by foot.

Our accommodation is very central so we went for a stroll to see the **Peace Memorial Park** and **[A-bomb Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial)**. It was an amazing experience to
be in the place we have only seen on a TV or read in the history books. It was touching and emotional for both of us.

Later we went to see **Hiroshima Castle**. Of course it is not the original one from 1589 as that one was destroyed by the bomb. The one we can admire now was opened in 1958. Also I must say that it looks more impressive from the outside than from the inside. It feels like it was designed as a museum for kids.

One of the most popular dishes in Hiroshima is [Okonomiyaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki). It's a pancake type of dish that contains variety of ingredients. There are 2 main types of Okonomiyaki, Osaka and Hiroshima style.
In Hiroshima, the ingredients are layered rather than mixed. The layers are typically batter, cabbage, pork, and many optional items such as squid, octopus, and cheese. Noodles are also used as a topping with fried egg and a generous amount of okonomiyaki sauce.

Our tonight's shopping: plum wine, beer, sushi, instant ramen (very yummi), japanese type of sweets, that are not so sweet for someone from Europe, and avocado snacks.
