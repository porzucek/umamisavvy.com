For the last full day in Japan we were considering 2 things - staying in Tokyo and continue with sightseeing or going for a day trip to Nikko.
The former won and we had a very laid back day.

We again went down to Tokyu Hands for a quick shopping and then strolled to **Imperial Palace**. Unfortunately the garden we wanted to see is closed on Fridays, so we walked around the palace and admire the composition of sky scrapers with the vast, peaceful area surrounding the palace.

Then we decided on a 5km walk to the **[Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Gyoen)**. The garden is a mix of three distinct styles: French, English landscape and Japanese traditional. After we got there we were sad that we didn't come there earlier.
The place is absolutely stunning. Probably one of the best green spots we've seen in Japan.

In the evening we found a happy hours deal, where every drink was only 250yen. We spent there only 1hour, but we were very cheerful when we left the place.

Last stop was Akihabara, where we went again to check out some managa shops.
