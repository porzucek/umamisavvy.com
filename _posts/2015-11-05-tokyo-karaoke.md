In the morning we went to Kappabashi street which is called the **Kitchen Town**. There are shops selling all restaurant equipment - wooden bento boxes, cutlery, [food replicas](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5933.html), etc. . We got there our garlic grater for 168 yens :-)

Our next stop was **Sens≈ç-ji** a very famous ancient Buddhist temple located in Asakusa. The area is extremely popular among tourist and everyone wants to take a photo with the huge paper lantern which is on the entrance - and so did we :-) After being in Kyoto, Nara, Kamakura the tempe itself didn't surprised us. There is also a shopping street of over 200 metres long, called Nakamise - another place where you can by all possible souvenirs.

When we left the Temple area we had a view on **Tokyo Skytree**. It's the second tallest structure in the world and has 634.0 metres.

Our main destination for the day was **Karaoke** shop. Karaoke experience was on our "must do" list. After some googling - to compare prices and get some info how it all works we went to a place close to Ueno station. The deal was 165 yens per person per half an hour with all you can drink (soft drinks only). It took us a while to figure out all the equipment but after that it was just 2 hours of pure fun! We were surprised how many English songs are available - almost everything we wanted was there.

Tokyo is amazing - neverending neons, pubs, bars, restaurants. Everything is big, shiny, colorful. Not only one area looks like that - almost everywhere you will find something special and eye catching.

**Kabukicho**, a part of Shinjuku is known as a red-light district. It is full of host and hostess clubs, bars, and love hotels.

We went to **Harajuku** as we were hoping to see [Harajuku lolitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_fashion#Gothic_Lolita) but we were unlucky.

From Harajuku we walked to **Roppongi Hills** to see **Maman** bronze, stainless steel, and marble sculpture of spider. It is among the world's largest, measuring over 9 metres high. Spider has a sac containing 26 marble eggs and its abdomen and thorax are made of ribbed bronze.

On the way to a train station we strolled by the **Tokyo Tower** which is a communications and observation tower and is 332.9 metres high. There is a main observatory located at 150 metres and special observatory at 250 metres but to access both you need to pay 1600 yens.

Tokyo is ready for Christmas - all around the city you can see Christmas decorations.
