We arrived at the Tokyo Station at 21:30. We didn't have any particular plans for the first night.
We left our luggage in one of many lockers that are provided at the station (the cost was 1100Y for 2 lockers) and we went off.

For first 30min we were lost inside the station, but then we found our way out and we headed towards the Gimza area.

On the way there we found a small restaurant, that you order and pay outside the building (Japan is great if you don't want to make too much contact with others). Once you select what you want and pay in the machine, you get a ticket with your order. You take it inside, pass it to the man behind the counter and wait. It takes ~5min to get the food. Meal was decent and cheap- we paid only 1000Y for two.

As we had the whole night and we've decided to go and explore as much as possible. We headed towards the Roppongi district, as it's a centre of the night life in Tokyo.
It took us about 1.5h to get there and, as we had expected, there were still a few places open, and people partying.

We weren't in the mood for a party, so we went only for a beer to a place that smelled like a fish boat, but looked nice enough to lure us in.

After ~1 hour we started moving back towards Tokyo station to catch our early train to Kyoto. We took different route that time, and met a few  spiders.
